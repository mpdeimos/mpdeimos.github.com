2011 was a year with quite a few album releases, so I asked myself recently which one I like most. The descision is not easy since I grabbed CDs from different metal genres, but let's see...

The contenders
--------------

My first task was to get a list of the albums I bought in 2011. Fingers
crossed that I did not miss a disc.

-   Before the Dawn - Blackstar Rising
-   Draconian - A Rose For The Apocalypse
-   Evergrey - Glorious Collision
-   Ljungblut - Over skyene skinner alltid solen
-   Nightwish - Imaginaerum
-   Symphony X - Iconoclast

My Voting
---------

1.  Draconian - A Rose For The Apocalypse
2.  Ljungblut - Over skyene skinner alltid solen
3.  Nightwish - Imaginaerum
4.  Symphony X - Iconoclast
5.  Before the Dawn - Blackstar Rising
6.  Evergrey - Glorious Collision

My Voting - Explained
---------------------

Upfront, all the albums listed there are good ones — otherwise I would
not have bought them. This is just a listing based on how often I
listened to the album and if it had worn off or not.

My winner for 2011 clearly is the new Draconian album *A Rose For The
Apocalypse*. Although I miss the duelling female/male vocals from
earlier releases, they showed how to create a Goth/Doom masterpiece with
an ongonig theme throughout the whole album. There are catchy riffs,
great clean voice parts and shivering screams. Everytime I give this one
a spin it’s a new adventure! It’s really sad that Lisa decided to quit
the band just after the album release.

Running up: Ljunglut with *Over skyene skinner alltid solen*. This is
the third solo release of Kim Ljung, bassist of Zeromancer & Seigmen.
The whole album has Norwegian lyrics and tries to cross the gap between
Synth, Rock and Industrial. The reason for why I really like this disc
is its diversity — within the album and also in contrast to my usual
Metal preferences.

The third place takes *Imaginaerum* — the new Nightwish opus. The album
leverages cinematic themes but offers quite varying songs. Compared to
the predecessor *Dark Passion Play* Anette’s vocals fit better and the
songs are arranged to match her and not Tarja.

Other albums?
-------------

Of course there are other great albums, but there is a limit on budget,
isn’t it?
The only album that is still on my *to-buy-list*, is the new Ghost Brigade *Until
Fear No Longer Defines Us*. They have offered a free stream for one
week, and I really liked it. So maybe it would range somewhere between
Ljunblut and Symphony X.

2012?
-----

2012 offers some promising releases as well: Swallow the Sun, Megaherz,
Voices of Destiny, Eisbrecher, Tremonti, … With Voices of Destiny and
Megaherz already being in my 2012 collection. This will give a hard
descision as well!
