Just one year after his last studio album *Lonely are the Brave* Jorn
releases another rocking studio album. So if you think this will just be
a mainstream album because of the short time it took to be produced, you
are wrong.

*Spirit Black* is a mixture between *The Duke* and *Lonely are the Brave*
with the sound tending a bit more to Hard Rock this time and
guitars taking a bigger role. Jorn himself said that he wanted to create
a memorable album - we’ll see if this worked out in a few years[^1].
Moreover, the album features a cover version of Tarja’s (ex-Nightwish)
song “I walk Alone” - It’s a bit different from the original but yet
another great cover song Jorn performed.
My favorite songs of the album are Down (2).

[^1]: Right now (=2011) I think he did not succeed with creating a album
    that might get a play every week, since I have some discs that
    havn’t worn off as fast. Yea, you have heard right - the album has
    worn off! Like you have read I was quiet enthusiastic about the
    album and thus gave it a spin now and then. But when I listen to it
    these days it sounds quite boring and a bit overproduced with all
    those effects. Would be cool to know what you think?
