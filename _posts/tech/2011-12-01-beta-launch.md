The time has come -- mpdeimos.com finally gets a web presentation!
Almost 2 years after I've grabbed the domain and some controversial ideas of what to do with it I have decided to start with a simple Jekyll-powered blog.

Beta launch of mpdeimos.com
===========================

Yep, you have heard right! I grabbed this domain on January 10th back in
2010 and almost 2 years later I came around to put some valid content on
it.
You might ask now what the heck I have done during this time?
Well, I had no time and no concrete idea of what to do with the domain---Ok, that is
not quite correct. I know that I wanted to have some sort of personal
blog and a portfolio of my work.

*So why the wait?*

I had no clue what software to use. You might think that’s not relevant?
I think it is.

So first my intention was to write an own small blogging engine with Php
based upon the [Woltlab Community
Framework](https://github.com/WoltLab/WCF). I know this framework very
well and it wouldn’t be much hassle to achieve this, but I never came
round to start developing the actual blogging plugin.

Wordpress to the rescue! After Wordpress 3.0 has been released
I’ve installed it on my webserver and migrated some of my old posts to
this platform. Despite Wordpress being quite customizable and easy to
handle I never felt home. …Dunno, maybe it felt not *hacky* enough?

*The final descision*

On some eve I stumbled across Jekyll, a static, blog-aware site
generator with support for Markdown and Textile. **Great!** A few days
late I found myself messing with a basic template and the raw site
skeleton.

What’s so great about Jekyll
----------------------------

-   It’s free
-   Posts can be written using Markdown, Textile or plain Html -- enough for a simple development-oriented blog.
-   A flexible directory structure
-   Extensible
-   Can be hosted (and built) on [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com) -- for free

What’s next?
------------

As you can see I managed to gather a few blog posts, but that’s just the
first step. I want to offer an overview about all my projects, some
client work and other stuff.
