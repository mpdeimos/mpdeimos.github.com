My first post on my company's blog concerns a benchmark regarding redundancy in build (continuous integration) systems.
It is the result of a scientific study I performed together with [Shane McIntosh](http://shanemcintosh.org/).
In addition, it outlines the achievements of refactoring a large-scale build infrastructure of one of our customers.

For further in-depth information and statistical details, Iâ€™d recommend reading the scientific article [Collecting and Leveraging a Benchmark of Build System Clones to Aid in Quality Assessments we published together with Shane McIntosh, Audris Mockus, Bram Adams, Ahmed E. Hassan, Brigitte Haupt and Christian Wagner](https://www.cqse.eu/publications/2014-collecting-and-leveraging-a-benchmark-of-build-system-clones-to-aid-in-quality-assessments.pdf) in the proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Software Engineering 2014.
