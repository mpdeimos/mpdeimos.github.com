Today marks the release of the all new Ubuntu 11.04.
And it marks a new OS experience for me: I'm actually moving from Windows to the Linux---after 12 years of happy Windows computing.

The past
--------

Well, I got my first WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus and Pointers) based PC
on Christmas 1999 featuring Windows 98 as operating system. Before I
grew up with an old 12MHz DOS based system (this PC actually had a
weight of 20kg!).
But back to my Windows PC: I really liked it. I kept it for almost 4
years, expanded the memory and hard drive; played games like Quake3, Medal of Honor or
RTCW; and most importantly began to mess around with code: First some
simple JavaScript stuff, after a while I also tried coding Winamp3
skins. From there on I tried lots of coding languages, tutorials and
also got involved with interface design.
The result was a set of Programs I really do not want to miss anymore.
Here is an overview:
* Winamp — my first love
* Trillian
* Opera
* Adobe Photoshop
* Eclipse
* mp3Tag

The now
-------

So all this was some time ago. In the meantime I enrolled at university,
got some more insight to Linux, it’s terminal and open source software.
Nevertheless I never dared to perform a full switch to a Linux based OS
and stayed with a dual boot…

…Till today. The release of Ubuntu 11.04 and it’s totally revamped user
interface have won me over! Actually the move was easier than I thought
and I didn’t boot into Windows for at least two weeks :)

But what happened to my *beloved* programs? (Remark: This is written as
a retrospective three months after my move to Ubuntu).
* **Winamp** — replaced by gmusicbrowser
* **Trillian** — runs via Wine. I know there is Empathy and Pidgin, but
Trillian has so nice sync features with my Android phone. …
* **Opera** — runs natively :)
* **Adobe Photoshop** — As I own a valid license I first tried running
it via Wine, but this did not work out too well. So I needed to take the
bitter pill: Running it via VirtualBox with a slim Windows Server 2003.
I know about GIMP - but Photoshop is just so much better ;)
* **Eclipse** — based on Java… so no problems running it with Linux.
* **mp3Tag** — PuddleTag

The future…
-----------

…will deffo be free of Windows as main operating system.
