<h1 id="feature-highlights">Feature Highlights</h1>

<ul>
  <li>One of the first single-window user-interfaces for Winamp at this time</li>
  <li>A web browser including bookmark support and music scraping (listen &amp; download embedded music)</li>
  <li>Two versions of the interface for normal and high-resolution monitors using a single code base</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="focus-of-my-work">Focus of my Work</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Transforming the awesome Photoshop mock-ups of <a href="http://taberbuhl.com/">Taber Buhl</a> into a pixel-perfect user interface</li>
  <li>Suggesting modifications to the design and provide ideas for new features</li>
  <li>Writing interaction logic in Winamp’s own UI scripting language</li>
  <li>Extending the C++ skinning engine with the core development team</li>
</ul>

<p>After the initial release in October 2007, I have provided several updates to the interface and adjusted it to new requirements.
In retrospective it was a nice experience to work remotely on such a popular software product at a time where tools like Skype or Google Hangouts were not that common or just unusable via a 56k dial-up modem.
Moreover, I can pretend that I was part of the digital music revolution <img class="emoji" title=":muscle:" alt=":muscle:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4aa.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p><a href="http://winamp.com" class="btn btn--primary">Enjoy Winamp ♪</a></p>

<p>…Oh, and according to <a href="http://www.eeggs.com/tree/555.html">this list</a> I have also written the top Winamp easter egg “Llama Snake” <img class="emoji" title=":blush:" alt=":blush:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f60a.png" height="20" width="20"></p>
