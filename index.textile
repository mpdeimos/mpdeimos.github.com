h1. Welcome!

I’m still in the *making* of this website and the blog. Nevertheless there are a few posts that I’ve imported from my old myOpera spot and some of my album reviews from ClassicProSkinning. Check them out in the "Blog section":/blog!

h3. Update 2

I'm still in the works of getting some contentent online... life is just too busy ;) You may also want to check my open-source devleopment at "Github":git@github.com:mpdeimos

h3. Update

I'm now with "CQSE GmbH":http://www.cqse.eu

h3. So what can you expect to see here in the future?

I'm planning to divide the website in 2 main parts, but this is still a moving target:

* *Blog* -- A simple blog (powered by Jekyll) containing random thoughts, development updates, music reviews, basically everything I am involved with ;)
* *Portfolio* -- Reference to all projects & client work I've participated in.



Stay tuned
 -Martin
