Just one year after his last studio album "Lonely are the Brave" Jorn releases another rocking studio album. So if you think this will just be a mainstream album because of the short time it took to be produced, you are wrong.

"Spirit Black" is a mixture between "The Duke" and "Lonely are the Brave" with the sound tending a bit more to Hard Rock this time and guitars taking a bigger role. Jorn himself said that he wanted to create a momorizable album - we'll see if this worked out in a few years[1].
Moreover, the album features a cover version of Tarja's (ex-Nightwish) song "I walk Alone" - It's a bit different from the original but yet another great cover song Jorn performed.
My favorite songs of the album are Down (2), City Inbetween (5) and ... oh well, I really cannot decide, I like most of the songs.
If you are a Heavy Metal or Hard Rock fan, this is an album you need to check out before you go and buy another CD.

fn1. Right now (=2011) I think he did not succeed with creating a album that might get a play every week, since I have some discs that havn't worn off as fast. Yea, you have heard right - the album has worn off! Like you have read I was quiet enthusiastic about the album and thus gave it a spin now and then. But when I listen to it these days it sounds quite boring and a bit overproduced with all those effects. Would be cool to know what you think?
