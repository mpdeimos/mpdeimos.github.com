excerpt: 2011 was a year with quite a few album releases, so I asked myself recently which one I like most. The descision ain't easy since I grabbed CDs from different metal genres... let's see!

* Before the Dawn - Blackstar Rising
* Draconian - A Rose For The Apocalypse
* Evergrey - Glorious Collision
* Ljungblut - Over skyene skinner alltid solen
* Nightwish - Imaginaerum
* Symphony X - Iconoclast

h2. My Voting - Explained

Upfront, all the albums listed there are good ones -- otherwise I would not have bought them. This is just a listing based on how often I listened to the album and if it had worn off or not.

My winner for 2011 clearly is the new Draconian album _A Rose For The Apocalypse_. Although I miss the duelling female/male vocals from earlier releases, they showed how to create a Goth/Doom masterpiece with an ongonig theme throughout the whole album. There are catchy riffs, great clean voice parts and shivering screams. Everytime I give this one a spin it's a new adventure! It's really sad that Lisa decided to quit the band just after the album release.

Running up: Ljunglut with _Over skyene skinner alltid solen_. This is the third solo release of Kim Ljung, bassist of Zeromancer & Seigmen. The whole album has Norwegian lyrics and tries to cross the gap between Synth, Rock and Industrial. The reason for why I really like this disc is its diversity -- within the album and also in contrast to my usual Metal preferences.

The third place takes _Imaginaerum_ -- the new Nightwish opus. The album leverages cinematic themes but offers quite varying songs. Compared to the predecessor _Dark Passion Play_ Anette's vocals fit better and the songs are arranged to match her and not Tarja.

h2. Other albums?

Of course there are other great albums, but there is a limit on budget, isn't it?
The only album that is still on my list, is the new Ghost Brigade _Until Fear No Longer Defines Us_. They have offered a free stream for one week, and I really liked it. So maybe it would range somewhere between Ljunblut and Symphony X.

h2. 2012?

2012 offers some promising releases as well: Swallow the Sun, Megahrez, Voices of Destiny, Eisbrecher, Tremonti, ... With Voices of Destiny and Megaherz already being in my 2012 collection. This will give me a hard descision as well!
