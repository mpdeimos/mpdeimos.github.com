Hi, my name is Martin Pöhlmann --- [software engineer](/portfolio/dev) and [consultant](/work/cqse) hailing from Munich.

![This is me!](/res/misc/me.png)

Born in a small town in the Bavarian forest my digital life begun with my [passion for music](/music).
Using the popular media player [Winamp](http://winamp.com) for listening to music on a daily basis, I became interested in drawing and coding interface designs for Winamp.
Together with some fellows we created [The Skin Consortium](http://skinconsortium.com) --- a successful community for interface design and coding.
In 2006 I was hired by AOL to develop the [default user interface for Winamp](/work/nullsoft).

After finishing high-school in 2007, I made my way to Munich to study computer science at the Technische Universität München.
My major research and study fields were software engineering, computer vision and human-machine-interaction.
During these years I also worked on a mobile music promotion platform called [Songpier](/work/pierlane) and again for AOL on the [Winamp for Android App](/work/nullsoft).
After a total of 9 semesters, I obtained the Master Degree in Computer Science in early 2012.

Since then, I am working as [consultant for continuous quality control](/work/cqse) at [CQSE](http://www.cqse.eu).
