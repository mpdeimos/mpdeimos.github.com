Hi, my name is Martin Pöhlmann --- [Software Engineer](https://github.com/mpdeimos) and [Consultant](https://cqse.eu/poehlmann) hailing from Munich.

Born in a small town in the Bavarian forest my digital life begun with my [passion for music](https://www.last.fm/user/mpdeimos).
Using the popular media player [Winamp](https://winamp.com) for listening to music on a daily basis, I became interested in designing and coding interface designs for Winamp.
Together with some fellows we created The Skin Consortium --- a successful community for interface design and coding.
In 2006 I was hired by AOL to develop the [next user interface for Winamp](/works/professional/winamp-desktop).

After finishing high-school in 2007, I made my way to Munich to study computer science at Technische Universität München.
My major research and study fields were software engineering, computer vision and human-machine-interaction.
During these years I co-founded a mobile music promotion platform called [Songpier](/works/professional/songpier/) and worked again for AOL on the [Winamp for Android App](http://localhost:4000/works/professional/winamp-android/).
After a total of 9 semesters, I obtained the Master Degree in Computer Science in early 2012.

Since then, I am working as software engineer and consultant at [CQSE](https://www.cqse.eu).
My daily work roughly splits into three areas:
First, I'm lead of a consulting project for one of our largest customer in the reinsurance sector.
In this project we preserve maintainability of source code and accompany the testing activities of the complete business application portfolio.
Second, I'm contributing to our software intelligence suite suite [Teamscale](https://teamscale.com) focusing on integration points with the Microsoft ecosystem (e.g. Visual Studio integration, Azure DevOps, .net Profiling, ...) using Java and C#.
Last but not least, I'm part of our small IT infrastructure and operations team and thus responsible for running and developing internal services on our Docker infrastructure.

As antipole to tech I keep myself fit with running or hiking and (re-)started dancing a few years back.
