> With "smart" mobile phones getting more and more popular in the late 2000s it was clear that the the journey of the Llama will continue there.
> In 2010, when Android was still on Version 2 "Eclair" we started an effort to bring the media player that we all love to Android and released the first version by the end of that year.
> Soon it entered the Top10 Android App Charts in the Play Store :rocket:

# Feature Highlights

* Wireless (and wired) music synchronization with [Winamp for PC](/portfolio/winamp-desktop/) and Mac
* Custom audio playback engine (called Replicant) with advanced features like replay-gain, equalizer, ...
* Integration of ShoutCAST internet radio and RSS music feed subscriptions

# Focus of my Work

* Transforming the awesome Photoshop mock-ups of [Taber Buhl](http://taberbuhl.com/) into a pixel-perfect user interface
* Writing resource-optimized Java code for Android---at that time you only had low-spec CPUs with a single core and less than 256MB RAM available
* Online music service integration

Sadly, Winamp for Android discontinued after selling the brand to Radionomy.
