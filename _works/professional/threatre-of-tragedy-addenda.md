Back in 2009 I've contributed in a competition for designing the cover art of an EP for the norwegian band [Theatre of Tragedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_Tragedy).
I've adapted an image of a forest in my hometown that had been destroyed by bark beetle to match their current album's fiery colorization.

As a long-time fan of the pioneers of the gothic metal genre I was stunned to win this competition.
In addition, I was honored to complete the artwork by also illustrating the booklet and inlay.
