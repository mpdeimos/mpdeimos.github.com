After revamping the [Winamp Desktop UI](/portfolio/winamp-desktop/) I've designed a refreshed look and feel for the open-source [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/).
The new design is shipped with the default distribution of the media player alongside the QT-based platform UI and can be chosen right away from the preferences.

# Focus of my Work

* Providing an unobtrusive borderless interface design following current design trends
* Realizing the design with VLC's interface definition language
