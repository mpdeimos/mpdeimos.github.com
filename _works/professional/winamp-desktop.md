> During my last year at high school I was hired[^1] by AOL (the former owner of Winamp) to revamp the whole Winamp user interface and combine separate windows (player, equalizer, playlist, ...) into a single tabbed user interface.
> At that time Winamp was one of the most popular media players for Windows---with more that 80+ million unique users per month.
> And yes, you once had audio files on your physical hard drive :smile:
>
> On October the 10<sup>th</sup> 2007 we released the new user interface titled *Bento* with Winamp 5.5 "10th anniversary edition". 

# Feature Highlights

* One of the first single-window user-interfaces for Winamp at this time
* A web browser including bookmark support and music scraping (listen & download embedded music)
* Two versions of the interface for normal and high-resolution monitors using a single code base

# Focus of my Work

* Transforming the awesome Photoshop mock-ups of [Taber Buhl](http://taberbuhl.com/) into a pixel-perfect user interface
* Suggesting modifications to the design and provide ideas for new features
* Writing interaction logic in Winamp's own UI scripting language
* Extending the C++ skinning engine with the core development team

After the initial release in October 2007, I have provided several updates to the interface and adjusted it to new requirements.
In retrospective it was a nice experience to work remotely on such a popular software product at a time where tools like Skype or Google Hangouts were not that common or just unusable via a 56k dial-up modem.
Moreover, I can pretend that I was part of the digital music revolution :muscle:

...Oh, and according to [this list](http://www.eeggs.com/tree/555.html) I have also written the top Winamp easter egg "Llama Snake" :blush:

[^1]: Due to the lack of a developer for the so-called skins (Justin Frankel was long gone) I was asked to fill this gap as I was an active member in the [Winamp skinning community](http://skinconsortium.com) at this time.
