![heavy metal](/res/misc/pommesgabel-thumb.jpg)

If there is something in life I refrain from making compromises, than it's music.
There are hardly other tunes besides fine metal which reach my ears---in particular gothic metal.
One may call me rigid, but the wrong music is definitely a reason to leave. No matter whom or where from.

Although I am not able to play any instrument or sing---maybe besides playing the air guitar and growling off-key---I was lucky to support the gothic metal pioneers [Theatre of Tragedy](https://www.pagesoftragedy.com) (one of my favorite bands) with [artwork for their last EP](/portfolio/gfx/theatre-of-tragedy-addendy-ep).

If you are interested, that's what I've been listening to during the last month (scrobbled via [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/mpdeimos) and layouted with [Last.fm Tools](http://lastfm.dontdrinkandroot.net/)):
