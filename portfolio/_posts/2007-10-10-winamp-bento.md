After obtaining the Master of Science degree in Computer Science at the Technische Universität München I've started working as consultant for continuous quality control at [CQSE](http://www.cqse.eu) in Munich.

Besides consulting I'm involved in the development of our advanced tools for software quality analysis [Teamscale](http://teamscale.cqse.eu) and [ConQAT](http://conqat.cqse.eu).
CQSE also provides a flexible base for combining regular work and [scientific research](https://www.cqse.eu/en/team/martin-poehlmann/).
