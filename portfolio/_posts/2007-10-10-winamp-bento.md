excerpt: Winamp default user interface since version 5.5 called Bento.
company: Nullsoft
---

AOL (the former owner of Winamp) set the goal for the Winamp 5.5 "10th anniversary edition" to revamp its player interface from multiple small windows (player, equalizer, playlist, ...) to a single user interface called "Bento" with tabs for different player aspects.
Due to the lack of a developer for the so-called skins (Justin Frankel was long gone) I was asked to fill this gap as I was an active member in the [Winamp skinning community](http://skinconsortium.com) at this time.

### Main focus of my work:

* Transforming the awsome Photoshop mock-ups from [Taber Buhl](http://taberbuhl.com/) into a pixel-perfect interface and suggesting modifications to the design
* Writing the layout using Wasabi XML -- this is Winamp's own layout engine for skins
* Developing interaction logic using MAKI -- this is Winamp's own scripting language for skins
* Extending the skinning engine in C++ together with the core development team

### Some feature highlights:

* One of the first single-user-interfaces for Winamp at this time
* A web browser including bookmark support and music scraping (listen / download embedded music)
* Two versions of the interface for normal and high-resolution monitors using a single code base

After the initial release in October 2007, I have provided several updates to the interface and adjusted it to new requirements.
In retrospective it was a nice experience to work remotely on a software product at a time where tools like Skype or Google Hangouts were not common -- besides that I was connected to the net via 56k dial-up.

...oh, and according to [this list](http://www.eeggs.com/tree/555.html) I have also written the top Winamp easter egg "Llama Snake".
