After obtaining my Master's degree in Computer Science at the Technische Universität München in 2012, I've started working as consultant for continuous quality control at [CQSE](http://www.cqse.eu) in Munich.
This includes monitoring several quality aspects of our customer's software systems and working out tasks to improve quality or to stop its decay.

Besides consulting I'm involved in the development of our advanced tools for software quality analysis [Teamscale](http://teamscale.cqse.eu) and [ConQAT](http://conqat.cqse.eu).
CQSE also provides a flexible base for combining regular work and [scientific research](https://www.cqse.eu/en/team/martin-poehlmann/).
